        <h2> About Me</h2>

        <p> I am a senior at The University of
            Massachusetts Lowell, majoring in Computer Science.
            From a young age, I was always interested in computers. I learned early on how to build a PC after upgrading 
            the PC components in my old deskop with money I had saved. While in high school, I took an introductory class to computer programming in C 
            which further piqued my interest in computers, particularly in software. Since then, I have gained experience in C, C++, Java, as well as 
            x86 assembly language; I am excited to expand my knowlege and hone my current skills in Computer Science. Currently,
            I am learning HTMl and CSS, with the creation of this website being my first project using these languages.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of academics, I enjoy exercising, reading, and spending time with friends.
